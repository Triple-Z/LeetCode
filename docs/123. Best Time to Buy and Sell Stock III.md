# 123. Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock III

- Difficulty: Hard
- Topics: `Array`, `Dynamic Programming`
- Link: https://leetcode.com/problems/best-time-to-buy-and-sell-stock-iii

## Description

Say you have an array for which the ith element is the price of a given stock on day i.

Design an algorithm to find the maximum profit. You may complete at most two transactions.

Note: You may not engage in multiple transactions at the same time (i.e., you must sell the stock before you buy again).

Example 1:

```
Input: [3,3,5,0,0,3,1,4]
Output: 6
Explanation: Buy on day 4 (price = 0) and sell on day 6 (price = 3), profit = 3-0 = 3.
             Then buy on day 7 (price = 1) and sell on day 8 (price = 4), profit = 4-1 = 3.
```

Example 2:

```
Input: [1,2,3,4,5]
Output: 4
Explanation: Buy on day 1 (price = 1) and sell on day 5 (price = 5), profit = 5-1 = 4.
             Note that you cannot buy on day 1, buy on day 2 and sell them later, as you are
             engaging multiple transactions at the same time. You must sell before buying again.
```

Example 3:

```
Input: [7,6,4,3,1]
Output: 0
Explanation: In this case, no transaction is done, i.e. max profit = 0.
```

## Solution

### One pass

在 LC 上看到的特别奇妙的解法，甚至有人画了状态机来[解释](https://leetcode.com/problems/best-time-to-buy-and-sell-stock-iii/discuss/149383/Easy-DP-solution-using-state-machine-O(n)-time-complexity-O(1)-space-complexity)。该算法时间复杂度为 O(n)，运行时间 4 ms，超过 100% 的 C++ 提交。

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int maxProfit(vector<int>& prices) {
        int buy1 = INT_MIN, buy2 = INT_MIN;
        int sell1 = 0, sell2 = 0;
        
        for (auto price: prices) {
            buy1 = max(buy1, -price);
            sell1 = max(sell1, price + buy1);
            buy2 = max(buy2, sell1 - price);
            sell2 = max(sell2, price + buy2);
        }
        
        return sell2;
    }
};
```
