# 121. Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock

- Difficulty: Easy
- Topics: `Array`, `Dynamic Programming`
- Link: https://leetcode.com/problems/best-time-to-buy-and-sell-stock/

## Description

Say you have an array for which the ith element is the price of a given stock on day i.

If you were only permitted to complete at most one transaction (i.e., buy one and sell one share of the stock), design an algorithm to find the maximum profit.

Note that you cannot sell a stock before you buy one.

Example 1:

```
Input: [7,1,5,3,6,4]
Output: 5
Explanation: Buy on day 2 (price = 1) and sell on day 5 (price = 6), profit = 6-1 = 5.
             Not 7-1 = 6, as selling price needs to be larger than buying price.
```

Example 2:

```
Input: [7,6,4,3,1]
Output: 0
Explanation: In this case, no transaction is done, i.e. max profit = 0.
```

## Solution

### Brute Force

暴力算法，算法时间复杂度为 O(n^2)，运行时间 392 ms，仅超过 6.11% 的 C++ 提交。

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int maxProfit(vector<int>& prices) {
        int max_profit = 0;
        
        for (auto it_i = prices.begin(); it_i != prices.end(); it_i++) {
            for (auto it_j = it_i + 1; it_j != prices.end(); it_j++) {
                if (max_profit < *it_j - *it_i) {
                    max_profit = *it_j - *it_i;
                }
            }
        }
        
        return max_profit;
    }
};
```

### One Pass

只需要遍历一次向量的算法。核心在于维护 `min_price` 和 `max_profit` 两个变量。由于买股票是有时序的，因此在正向遍历时不断更新最小值 `min_price` 并以该值为基础更新 最大利润 `max_profit` 。该算法时间复杂度为 O(n)，运行时间为 4 ms，超过 98.95% 的 C++ 提交。

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int maxProfit(vector<int>& prices) {
        int min_price = INT_MAX;
        int max_profit = 0;
        
        for (int price: prices) {
            if (price < min_price) 
                min_price = price;
            if (price - min_price > max_profit) 
                max_profit = price - min_price;
        }
        
        return max_profit;
    }
};
```
