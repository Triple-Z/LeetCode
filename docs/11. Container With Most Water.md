# 11. Container With Most Water

- Difficulty: Medium
- Topics: `Array`, `Two Pointers`
- Link: https://leetcode.com/problems/container-with-most-water/

## Description

Given n non-negative integers *a1, a2, ..., an* , where each represents a point at coordinate *(i, ai)*. n vertical lines are drawn such that the two endpoints of line *i* is at *(i, ai)* and *(i, 0)*. Find two lines, which together with x-axis forms a container, such that the container contains the most water.

Note: You may not slant the container and n is at least 2.

![maxArea](https://s3-lc-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2018/07/17/question_11.jpg)

The above vertical lines are represented by array [1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7]. In this case, the max area of water (blue section) the container can contain is 49.

 

Example:

```
Input: [1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7]
Output: 49
```

## Solution

### Brute Force

无脑暴力循环解，时间复杂度 O(n^2)，运行时间为 1024ms，仅超过 10.93% 的 C++ 提交。

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int maxArea(vector<int>& height) {
        // brute force
        int max_area = 0;
        for (auto it_i = height.begin(); it_i != height.end(); it_i++) {
            for (auto it_j = it_i+1; it_j != height.end(); it_j++) {
                if (min(*it_i, *it_j) * (it_j-it_i) > max_area) {
                    max_area = min(*it_i, *it_j) * (it_j-it_i);
                }
            }
        }
        return max_area;
    }
};
```

### Two Pointers

使用左右双指针，迭代条件为左右指针的值，越小的值（Barrier 越低）越先迭代。算法时间复杂度为 O(n)，空间复杂度为 O(1)。运行时间为 16ms，超过 96.53% C++ 提交。

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int maxArea(vector<int>& height) {
        auto left = height.begin(), right = height.end()-1;
        int max_area = 0;
        
        while (left < right) {
            if (min(*left, *right) * (right-left) > max_area) {
                max_area = min(*left, *right) * (right-left);
            }
            
            if (*left < *right) left++;
            else right--;
        }
        
        return max_area;
    }
};
```
