# 26. Remove Duplicates from Sorted Array

- Difficulty: Easy
- Topics: `Array`, `Two Pointers`

## Description

Given a sorted array nums, remove the duplicates in-place such that each element appear only once and return the new length.

Do not allocate extra space for another array, you must do this by **modifying the input array in-place** with O(1) extra memory.

**Example 1:**

```
Given nums = [1,1,2],

Your function should return length = 2, with the first two elements of nums being 1 and 2 respectively.

It doesn't matter what you leave beyond the returned length.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Given nums = [0,0,1,1,1,2,2,3,3,4],

Your function should return length = 5, with the first five elements of nums being modified to 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 respectively.

It doesn't matter what values are set beyond the returned length.
```

**Clarification:**

Confused why the returned value is an integer but your answer is an array?

Note that the input array is passed in by reference, which means modification to the input array will be known to the caller as well.

Internally you can think of this:

```cpp
// nums is passed in by reference. (i.e., without making a copy)
int len = removeDuplicates(nums);

// any modification to nums in your function would be known by the caller.
// using the length returned by your function, it prints the first len elements.
for (int i = 0; i < len; i++) {
    print(nums[i]);
}
```

## Solution

### Two Pointers

双指针的 idea，一个指针遍历数组，另一个指针根据前一个指针的状态来替换更改元素。该代码速度为 24ms，超过 94.35% 的 C++ 提交。

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int removeDuplicates(vector<int>& nums) {
        if (nums.size() == 0)
            return 0;
        else if (nums.size() == 1)
            return 1;
        
        auto ret = nums.begin()+1;
        
        for (auto it = nums.begin(); it != nums.end() && ret != nums.end(); it++) {
            if (it != nums.begin()) {
                if (*it == *(it-1)) {
                    // duplicate
                    continue;
                } else {
                    *ret = *it;
                    ret++;
                }
            }
        }
        
        return ret-nums.begin();
    }
};
```
